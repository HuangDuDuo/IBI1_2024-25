This is a reflection in IBI1_2024-25.
I think everything is going well.
I feel remembering to add and commit challenging.
During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!
